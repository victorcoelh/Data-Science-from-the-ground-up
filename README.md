# Data Science from the ground up
Implemeting Data Science/Machine Learning libraries from 0

Based off the book by Joel Grus:
Data Science from Scratch: First Principles with Python

### About
Re-implemented the libraries created in the Joel Grus book from scratch once again, using object-oriented programming and unit testing to ensure code cleaness and maintanability. This was created solely as practice, so I could better understand the concepts taught in the book.

For the original implementation, please refer to the actual repository for the book:
